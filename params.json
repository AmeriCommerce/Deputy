{"name":"Deputy","tagline":"Useful css helper classes","body":"Deputy CSS\r\n======\r\n\r\nDeputy CSS is a simple CSS \"library\" with helpful css classes for common design requirements.\r\n\r\nThe project is generated with SASS.\r\n\r\nIt includes padding, margin, width, border, color, typography, and general helpers.\r\n\r\nIt's a little bit backwards from the \"semantic only\" school of thought but it's what I prefer.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n=====\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Padding and Margin</h3>\r\n\r\n\"I want this div to have 20 pixels of padding\"\r\n--- Some guy\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"pad-20\">\r\n  stuff\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n  \r\nAlso included are helpers to apply padding to only certain sides of an element\r\n\r\n\"I want 20 pixels of padding on the left side of this div\"\r\n--- Same guy as before\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"pad-20 pad-l-only\">\r\n  stuff\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"pad-l-20\">\r\n  stuff\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nPadding and Margin classes are generated in increments of 5 up to 100. Each increment has 5 rules: \r\n```.pad-N, .pad-t-N, .pad-r-N, .pad-b-N and .pad-l-N``` (N being the iteration)\r\n\r\nThe same applies to margin.\r\n```.m-N, .m-t-N, .m-r-N, .m-b-N and .m-l-N```\r\n\r\n```.no-margin``` and ```.no-padding``` - These clear out margin and/or padding on an element.\r\n\r\nAdditional classes are available to clear margin/padding on certain sides.\r\nex. ```.no-pad-l, .no-m-l, .no-pad-tb, .no-m-lr```\r\n\r\nThere are also some special classes such as ```.m-auto``` which sets auto left and right margin.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Width</h3>\r\n\r\nWidth classes are generated from 1-100% as ```.w-1 {  } .... .w-100 {  }```\r\n\r\n<h3>Border</h3>\r\n\r\nBorder classes are generated from 1-10 such as \r\n```css\r\n/* border-3 */\r\n.border-3 { border: 3px solid; }\r\n.border-t-3 { border-top: 3px solid; }\r\n.border-r-3 { border-right: 3px solid; }\r\n.border-b-3 { border-bottom: 3px solid; }\r\n.border-l-3 { border-left: 3px solid; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis can be combined with other border classes for color and style.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"border-b-1 border-dashed border-grey\">\r\n  some thing\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
